# All for One ‚öîÔ∏è

## Project Context üí°

A project used to practice some SQL concepts. In this project, the Northwind database (`northwind.sql`) was used to make the queries. Each query is in a file called `desafio{N}.sql` where "N" is the number of the requirement that the file represents.

### Acquired Knowledge üìñ

In this project, I was able to:
- Find data in a Database using MySQL SELECT;
- Use MySQL functions CONCAT and COUNT;
- Distinct data using DISTINCT;
- Limit query results using LIMIT and LIMIT OFFSET;
- Sort data using ORDER BY;
- Filter data using WHERE clause, boolean operators, and relational operators;
- Manipulate data using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
